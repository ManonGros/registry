# Registration with GBIF: Bash shell script example

Registration with GBIF can be achived with two REST calls.

This script demonstrates the two calls, and records the response (the dataset key).

To run it, just run `./register.sh` â€” it uses the test GBIF at GBIF-UAT.org.

To create datasets for your own organization, you should ask helpdesk@gbif.org for `editor_rights` permissions for those organizations.
